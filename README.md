Machine identification of grimace scale in test rats.

This program aims to use an image of a rat's face to determine the degree to which it is in pain for laboratory settings. The code itself uses a simple thresholding function to make its decision.

To use this code, copy and paste the code into MATLAB or open the file in MATLAB, and insert the desired image's filename (.jpeg, .png, .tif). The code will then produce a result indicating if the rat is in pain based on the photo. Note, this is only for head-on images of the rat.
