Machine identification of grimace scale in test rats.

The purpose of this program is to use an image of a rat's face in order to determine the degree to which it is in pain for labratory settings. The code itself is a simple matlab thresholding function and a decision.

To use this code, simply coppy and paste code into matlab, and insert the filename of the desired image (jpeg., png., tif.). The code will then produce a result indicating the grimace scale rating of the rat's face in the photo. Note, this is only for head-on images of the rat.
